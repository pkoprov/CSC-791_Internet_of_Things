### Camera Client

Before running any scripts one has to modify the line 18 `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(2)` and substitute integer in
parentheses with the number of a camera that is attached to the computer. Additionally, open cv must be installed.
Run `pip install opencv-python` to install it.

After this one has to run the following script in terminal in this folder:

```commandline
cd IOT_ASSIGNMENT_2/PROJECT/CameraClient
python3 camera_client.py
```
