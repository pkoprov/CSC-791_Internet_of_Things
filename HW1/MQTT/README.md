## Instructions for Subscriber

The Subscriber should be run before the publisher. The 
Subscriber will ask for the IP of the Broker. Once the
subscriber has been started it will wait for messages from
the publisher. The publisher will specify how many files the
subscriber should expect to receive in addition to the QoS level.
Once the subscriber has received all the messages, it will
print of all information it recorded and reset
to reveive more messages.
